	<h1> Seamus Doherty WebApp Project Report </h1>
	<h2> Buy and Sell System </h2>
	Seamus Doherty ECE 4 - 14430468
	<br/><br/>
	The project assigned to me was a buy and sell syatem from which registered users could 
	advertise, view and place bids on items.
	<br/><br/>
	Test Login Credentials: Username - JSmith    Password - password
	<br/><br/>
	The SQL used to create the tables <br/><br/>
	<h3>For the user database:</h3>   CREATE TABLE SDOHERTYWEBAPP <br/>
							        (FULLNAME VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,<br/>
									 USERNAME VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,<br/>
									 PASSWORD VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,<br/>
							         EMAIL VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,<br/>
							         PHONE VARCHAR(25),<br/>
							         PRIMARY KEY (USERNAME))<br/><br/>
							         
	<h3>For the adverts:</h3>   CREATE TABLE SDOHERTYADVERTISEDATA <br/>
						        (ID INTEGER,<br/>
								 TITLE VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,<br/>
								 CATEGORY VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,<br/>
								 DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(2000) NOT NULL,<br/>
						         BID INTEGER,<br/>
						         USERNAME VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,<br/>
								 BIDDER VARCHAR(30),<br/>
							 	 PRIMARY KEY (ID),<br/>
							   	 CONSTRAINT CONSTSDADVERT<br/>
						    	 FOREIGN KEY (USERNAME)<br/>
						     	 REFERENCES SDOHERTYWEBAPP<br/>
						     	 ON DELETE SET NULL)<br/>   						        
   
	<br/><h3>The Web Application Design</h3> 
	The index/welcoming page of my application is a login page in which users must first
	login before accessing other features of the application
	<br/>A servlet checks if the entered user credentials match any records in the SQL database.
	If there is a match then the user is logged in and they can continue to the home page of the application.
	A HTTP session is created and assigned to the logged in user to allow them to access restricted
	parts of the application.
	<br/><br/> If incorrect credentials are entered the user is redirected to the login page and 
	informed with an error message, displayed above the login. There is a link in the login page to access 
	a registration page from which a user can sign up. The registration page submits the entered information 
	to a servlet which in turn inserts a new row in the user database for that user. The user is then free 
	to login.
	

	<br/><br/>The home page consists of a list of adverts currently in the database along with a 
	number of filtering options. The user can search for items with a keyword or by category. 
	<br/> There is a text field beside each item that allows users to place bids on items. 
	If a user places a bid on an item the item in the database is updated with that bid and the name of 
	the user that placed the bid. In order to update the correct item a Java Bean is created for the 
	item which contains all of its attributes. Using this Java Bean the servlet can distinguish the 
	items and access the required information.
	<br/> There is a delete option beside each item that allows the item to be removed from the site.
	Only the user that advertised the item may delete it, all other users are presented with an 
	invalid permissions warning. This warning is possible with JSPs. The servlet sends any error messages 
	to the JSP and it is displayed on screen. These event alerts are present throughout the application 
	and ensure the user is well informed of the events. 
	<br/> There is a link to an advertisement submission page in which users can advertise items
	under certain categories.
	
	<br/><br/><br/> The application makes use of a HTTP session to keep track of logged in users. If
	a user tries to access a page and does not have an active session then they are redirected 
	to the homepage where they are forced to login.
	<br/> The login page displays warnings if an invalid username or password is entered A warning 
	will also appear on the login page if the user attempts to access a restricted section of the 
	application. There are warning messages which appear if an unauthorised user attempts to delete
	an item.
	<br/><br/> Form Validation is used to make sure all required fields of all of the forms are filled
	in. This prevents incomplete forms being sent to the server and invalid SQL statements being
	processed.
	
	<br/><br/><h3>JSPs/HTML files and their associated servlets:</h3>
	index.jsp -> LoginServlet.java
	<br/>register.html -> RegServlet.java
	<br/>Home.jsp -> Home.java, Delete.java, PaceBid.java
	<br/>item.html -> AdvertServlet.java
